# TrustPix - A Private and Secure Instagram Alternative

Welcome to the TrustPix organization on GitHub! Our mission is to create a private and secure alternative to Instagram, prioritizing user privacy and data security. TrustPix aims to provide a platform where users can share their moments and connect with others without compromising their personal information.

## Project Overview

TrustPix consists of the following components:

1. **Mobile App**: A cross-platform mobile application built using React Native, supporting both Android and iOS devices. The app provides a seamless and intuitive user experience for sharing photos, engaging with others, and exploring content.

2. **Backend**: The backend of TrustPix is developed using Python, leveraging its robustness and extensive ecosystem. It serves as the API layer for the mobile app.

3. **Database**: TrustPix utilizes Redis as its primary database solution. Redis offers high performance, scalability, and real-time data processing capabilities, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
